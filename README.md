<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Exams, quizzes, assessments, etc. are all unavoidable parts of the current education system. My high school heavily used
the Scantron devices to deliver multiple choice tests. Scantron forms only allow for multiple choice and I often ended
track of marks on the paper due to separate test forms and answer forms. Inspired by the College Board's written AP 
assessments, this project hopes to deliver a quick and user-friendly application.

Here's how:
* By completing the prompts from the Command-Line Interface, you will be able to create a latex supported assessment
without the need to format it
* Using OpenCV and OCR, all relevant student marks on the assessment will be digitized and able to be graded manually 
or automatically

Of course, no exam format will serve all user preferences since your needs may be different. So I'll be continuing 
development in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening
an issue.
